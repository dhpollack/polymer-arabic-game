    <h3>Web browser "cookies"</h3>
    <p>Our Site may use "cookies"  or "HTML5 localStorage" to enhance User experience. We prefer localStorage as this maintains more user privacy and prevents data from being externally accessible.  See <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3220660/local-storage-vs-cookies" target="_blank">this</a> for a further explanation on the differences.  If we use cookies, user's web browser places cookies on their hard drive for record-keeping purposes and sometimes to track information about them. User may choose to set their web browser to refuse cookies, or to alert you when cookies are being sent. If they do so, note that some parts of the Site may not function properly.</p>

    <h3>How we protect your information</h3>
    <p>We adopt appropriate data collection, storage and processing practices and security measures to protect against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure or destruction of your personal information, username, password, transaction information and data stored on our Site.</p>
    
    <h3>Sharing your personal information</h3>
    <p>We may share or sell information with third parties for marketing or other purposes.</p>
    
    <h3>Electronic newsletters</h3>
    <p>If User decides to opt-in to our mailing list, they will receive emails that may include company news, updates, related product or service information, etc.</p>
    
    <h3>Third party websites</h3>
    <p>Users may find advertising or other content on our Site that link to the sites and services of our partners, suppliers, advertisers, sponsors, licencors and other third parties. We do not control the content or links that appear on these sites and are not responsible for the practices employed by websites linked to or from our Site. In addition, these sites or services, including their content and links, may be constantly changing. These sites and services may have their own privacy policies and customer service policies. Browsing and interaction on any other website, including websites which have a link to our Site, is subject to that website's own terms and policies.</p>
    
    <h3>California Online Privacy Protection Act</h3>
    <p>CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy.  The law's reach stretches well beyond California to require a person or company in the United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting personally identifiable information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals with whom it is being shared, and to comply with this policy. -  See more at: http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf<br>
    <strong>According to CalOPPA we agree to the following:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Users can visit our site anonymously</li>
      <li>Once this privacy policy is created, we will add a link to it on our home page, or as a minimum on the first significant page after entering our website.</li>
      <li>Our Privacy Policy link includes the word 'Privacy', and can be easily be found on the page specified above.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>How does our site handle do not track signals?</h3>
    <p>We don't honor do not track signals and do not track, plant cookies, or use advertising when a Do Not Track (DNT) browser mechanism is in place. We don't honor them because:<br>We do not collect much if any personally identifying information and adding DNT would be burdensome at this moment.  We may honor this at a future date, especially if we collect more personally identifying information.  But if you do not login to the site then very little information is gathered and none of this information is personally identifying.</p>
    
    <h3>Does our site allow third party behavioral tracking?</h3>
    <p>It's also important to note that we allow third party behavioral tracking, although this may not be implemented at the current time.  The purpose of tracking would be to improve the user experience and/or track how our users are using our service.</p>
    
    <h3>Changes to this privacy policy</h3>
    <p>tinavg - This Is Not A Vocabulary Game has the discretion to update this privacy policy at any time. When we do, we will post a notification on the main page of our Site. We encourage Users to frequently check this page for any changes to stay informed about how we are helping to protect the personal information we collect. You acknowledge and agree that it is your responsibility to review this privacy policy periodically and become aware of modifications.</p>

    <h3>Message From The Author</h3>
    <p>The wording of some of the privacy policy generator questions were a little unclear to me. Generally the most all-encompassing option available was chosen. In general, we are collecting the following information in the following situations:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <h4>No Login:</h4>
        <p>time of last login - bunched into a single pool of "anonymous" users. No PII is collected.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Twitter Login:</h4>
        <p>Twitter Name, Twitter UID, Most Recent Game Options, Login Time, Word Sequence, Letter Sequence</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Contact Form:</h4>
        <p>Email Address (so we can respond, not for a mailing list), Your Message</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>We reserve the right to collect location information in the future, although I would like to do further research into how to do this in the best manner. Most likely, I would like to collect city level geolocation data in order to understand which users are using which languages.</p>
